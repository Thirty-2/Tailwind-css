                    <h1>Our Founder</h1>
                    <p>Founded by Toyin Joseph, a young, vibrant educational enthusiast who started his education journey at the Federal College of Education, Okene, and later moved to the University of Abuja, where he earned a B.Sc in Political Science & International Relations. His passion for educating and enlightening young minds toward their future ambitions did not end there but moved him closer to his dreams.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other teachers who started teaching as a means to an end, Mr. Toyin began his journey to inspire young minds fortunate to come across his path as a tutor at St. Augustus College in Kabba in 1998 before moving to Jewel Model School Kubwa from Nov. 2000 – Aug. 2002. Still, in quest of a deeper understanding of the education system and the complexities of young minds, he moved to Turkish Secondary School Wuse 2 in Sept. 2002. He later joined the FCT Teaching Board, where he taught at P.W L.E.A Pry School Kubwa from 2002–2005, Government Secondary School Kubwa from 2005–2009, and Government Secondary School Maitama from late 2009–2010. He was also a part-time lecturer in political science for two years at the University of Abuja. Before fully committing to the next generation, he gained vast experience in the system, becoming a father figure, poet, orator, thinker, and the Chief Executive Officer of Zion Study Centre and Leadership Academy Kubwa.</p>
                    <p>He is a teacher, education consultant, and strategist who resigned from the civil service to give full attention to the great institution he founded, the “ZION STUDY CENTRE.” He is the author of "ALL YOU NEED IN GOVERNMENT" and the publisher of the weekly magazine “ECHOES FROM ZION.” He is a God-fearing, kind, intelligent, and dynamic gentleman.</p>
